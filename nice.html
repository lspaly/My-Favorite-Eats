	<h1>Lila's Favorite Dessert Places </h1>
  <hr>
<p>Here are my favorite places to get a sweet treat.</p>

  <li><a href= "https://saltandstraw.com/collections/shop-all/?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrsWXnt2ShgMVMQWtBh3H1gr0EAAYASAAEgInnvD_BwE">Salt and Straw:</a>
     Salt and Sraw has THE BEST dairy free ice cream (and regular ice cream) ever, and the most creative, delicous flavors. <center><img src="saltAndStraw.png"></center></li>

     <li><a href= "https://crumblcookies.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=CRUMBL-US+%7C+GOOGLE+%7C+BRANDED+SEARCH+%7C+ONGOING+%7C+CONVERSION+%7C+SEARCH&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIq5XF9t2ShgMVHyStBh2WtQ-kEAAYASAAEgKNtfD_BwE">
     crumbl cookies:</a>
     Crumbl has the best. cookies. ever. With new flavors weekly, crumbl never fails to have original cookies that are AMAZING. Whenever I am near a crumbl I have to get a 6 pack. <center><img src="crumbl.jpg"></center></li>

     <li><a href= "https://sidewalkjuice.com/">
     sidewalk juice:</a>
     Having been to sidewalk juice dozens of times, I find it ironic that I have never actually tried their juice. The real reason I go is for their amazing acai bowls. Their locations at SFO and throughout San Francisco never fail to deliver.  <center><img src="sidewalk.jpeg"></center></li>
