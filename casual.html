	<h1>Lila's Favorite Casual places to eat </h1>
<hr>
<p>Here are some casual places I love eating at. I'm in and out in under 45 minutes, but i never leave with an empty stomach.</p>

	<li><a href= "https://www.propositionchicken.com/">Proposition Chicken:</a>
		 Proposition Chicken is one of my all time favorite casual restaurants. I hear they have great chicken, but my personal favorites are the crispy tofu, potato wedges, and brussel sprouts. <center><img src="propChicken.jpeg"></center></li>
		 <li><a href= "https://www.superduperburgers.com/">Super Duper:</a>
		 Super Duper is a great place to get some food. They have multiple locations in San Francisco and Marin. I especially love their dipped ice cream cones. <center><img src="superDuper2.jpg"></center></li>

		 <li><a href= "https://www.noahs.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2JXNqJKBhgMVfwGtBh13-gx6EAAYAiAAEgIw-fD_BwE">Noah's Bagels:</a>
		 Noah's has the best bagels in the city. They are always so so fresh and delicious. My personal favorite is the sesame bagel, but they also have great bagel sandwiches.<center><img src="noahsBagels.jpg"></center></li>

		 Chipotle is my favorite restaurant of all time. I always get a bowl with beans, rice, guacamole, corn salsa, medium salsa, and chips. Their food is so delicous and they also have really good and clean ingredients. I will never stop loving Chipotle. <center><img src="chipotle.jpeg"></center></li>
